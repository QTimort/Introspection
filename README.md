> Introspection is the process of analyzing the underlying elements and properties of something, such as art, blockchain data, or programming, to gain a deeper understanding.

Introspection is a creative mix of data visualization, Solana blockchain, data, and art.
Each small block is a transaction, and its size and shape tell you something special about it.
Blue blocks are hopeful contestants, each aiming for success. The green block is the winner, standing out in its victory.
And the black blocks? They're the quiet ones, representing transactions failed or got rejected but that are still part of the story.
